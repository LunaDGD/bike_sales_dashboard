# Bike Sales Dashboard

In this project, I created a dashboard in Excel to analyze bike sales data. The goal of the dashboard was to identify patterns and insights regarding bike purchasing behavior based on demographic information such as gender, age, income, and education. The data set included information on whether a person purchased a bike or not, and their associated demographic information.

The dashboard was designed to allow the user to filter out different fields, such as gender, education, and income level, to gain a deeper understanding of how different demographics impact bike sales. The visualizations included bar and line graphs to help highlight key trends and patterns. By analyzing the data, I was able to identify key insights and make recommendations for how to improve bike sales to different demographic groups. Overall, this project allowed me to hone my Excel skills and apply data analysis techniques to real-world business problems.
